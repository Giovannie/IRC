<entry key="general">Hi, you used the /help command to get help for aicab.
Unforunately it is quiet difficult to explain all of its features in just some small lines.
To use aicab (Version 0.3.5, without GUI) you simply have to type '/command' and then some text depending on the command.
The following commands are available (pleas do not type "/command" but one of the following):
/away /cc /connect /cnotice /cprivmsg /ctcp /exit /help /info /invite /ison /join /kick /knock /list
/me /mode /names /nick /notice /oper /part /msg /quit /time /topic /trace /userhost /userip /version
/wallops /watch /whois /whowas
If you need further help to one of these commands please type /help 'command'.
</entry>
<entry key="/away">/away 'message'
Submits an away message to the irc server who should send this in response to future
private messages. Not tested (aicab 0.3.5)</entry>
<entry key="/cc">/cc 'command' 'params'
These are commands to configure aicab, your IRC-Client. To specify parameters is optional
though depending on the command necessary. Known commands are: "saveconfig" "config 'key' 'value'" and "readconfig".
Saveconfig saves the config data to your harddisk, config adds a key value pair to the config or
updates an existing one (if key already in use), readconfig reads the config from your harddisk.</entry>
<entry key="/connect">true</entry>
<entry key="/cnotice">This command is not implemented yet (aicab 0.3.5)</entry>
<entry key="/cprivmsg">This command is not implemented yet (aicab 0.3.5)</entry>
<entry key="/ctcp">/ctcp 'target' 'command'
This command sends a ctcp command to the target (normaly a nickname).
Supported Commands are "version" "time" and "ping". The "action" command is available via the /me command.
</entry>
<entry key="/exit">/exit 'message'
Ends the connection to the server (equal to quit) leaving a message (normaly specifying the reason for the leave).
Terminates the client afterwards. However the message isn't submitted correctly (aicab 0.3.5)
